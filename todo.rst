- [ ] Feedback logging needs rework ... pseudo-csv format spills across lines of text :(
- [ ] timestamps for feedback have messed up timezone coding (all Z-05.00?)
- [ ] Determine proper treatment of exams and/or quizzes
- [ ] What should we do with video or other media content?
- [ ] Set up so that the engine can be updated using composer (except for the data folder)!
